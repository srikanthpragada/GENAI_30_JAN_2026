Code Review for 1.math_agent.py

Overall, the script provides a basic framework for creating a simple mathematical agent using custom tools and a language model.

Strengths:
- Clear definition of mathematical tools with docstrings for each function.
- Modular approach, separating tools and agent creation.
- Usage of human-readable prompt.

Suggestions for Improvement:
1. Error Handling:
   - Currently, there is no handling for potential errors, especially in the divide function (e.g., division by zero). Consider adding try-except blocks.
2. Code Documentation:
   - While the tools have docstrings, additional comments explaining the overall flow and setup might help future maintainers.
3. Model Initialization:
   - Check if "gemini-2.5-flash" is available and the correct way to initialize it. Extra parameters or configuration might be necessary.
4. Testing and Validation:
   - Add examples of checking the response or handling cases where the response might be empty or malformed.
5. Security and Validation:
   - If inputs are user-provided, consider sanitization or validation, especially for division.
6. Consistency:
   - Function names are clear; ensure that the tools are registered and used correctly.

Overall, the structure is sound, but adding robustness and documentation would enhance maintainability and reliability.
